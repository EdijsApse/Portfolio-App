                    <h3>Junior Full-Stack Developer</h3>
                    <p>
                    Always knew WEB development is my passion and what I should do. <br/>
                    Whenever I start building something, or take a course to learn something new, it makes me feel excited, because I know, at the end of day I'm gonna be better than I were at the morning. <br/>
                    For me each day is an opportunity to become better than I was yesterday.
