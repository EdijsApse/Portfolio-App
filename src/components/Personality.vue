                <p>
                Sometimes I am hard on myself, always trying to push myself to the limit and test myself.
                I would say that I am very introvert person.
                Late night, coffee, peace, good music and code is what makes me comfortable.
                Like to solve problems, and not afraid of asking questions, about how things works, and what they are meant for.

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                Coding - obvious. Probably one of those persons who would love to earn by doing what he loves.<br />
                Like to watch Hockey games, also have been skating since I was 12, and playing hockey, not professionally, but still it made me happy.<br />
                Floorball was also one of my favorite sport. Loved to play it whenever I had a chance.
